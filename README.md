# MentorConnect

MentorConnect is a full-stack web application designed to connect aspiring entrepreneurs with experienced mentors. I built this project to simplify the process of finding the right mentorship and managing professional relationships online.

## Core Features
- Role-based profiles for Mentors and Entrepreneurs.
- Smart matching system based on skills and industry.
- Secure connection requests between users.
- Real-time chat functionality for accepted connections.
- Meeting scheduler to organize mentorship sessions.
- In-app notifications for new requests and meetings.
- Full authentication system with OTP password reset and account deletion options.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- Real-time Communication: Socket.IO
- Security: JWT Authentication, bcrypt password hashing, Nodemailer for OTPs

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run "npm install" to install all required dependencies.
3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your environment variables:
   - PORT (e.g., 5000)
   - MONGO_URI (your MongoDB connection string)
   - JWT_SECRET (your secret key for authentication)
   - EMAIL_USER (your gmail address for sending OTPs)
   - EMAIL_PASS (your gmail app password)
4. Start the server by running "npm run dev".
5. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.

## Architecture and File Structure

The project follows a clean Client-Server architecture and uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern on the backend to keep the code organized and scalable.

### Backend Architecture
- **Controllers:** Business logic lives here. For example, the user controller handles profile lookups, the auth controller manages JWT generation and OTP logic, and the message controller fetches chat history.
- **Routes:** Express router files that define the API endpoints. They map incoming HTTP requests (like POST /api/auth/login) to their respective controller functions. All protected routes run through a JWT authentication middleware first.
- **Models:** Mongoose schemas that define the structure of the MongoDB database. The core models include User, Connection, Message, Meeting, and Notification.
- **Real-time Engine:** Socket.IO is attached directly to the Express server to handle bidirectional events. When a user sends a chat message, the backend saves it to MongoDB and immediately broadcasts the "receiveMessage" event to the recipient's active socket room.
